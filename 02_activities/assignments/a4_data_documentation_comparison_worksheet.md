Random sample (phone panel).|**Convenience sample** (bats were captured and studied based on their presence in the field and in captivity, indicating that convenience was a key factor). **Purposive sampling** (the selection of bats and their faecal samples appears to be based on specific criteria related to the research question, such as their diet and behavior).|
| Sample size                                           |20,000.|Non-Probability Online Survey: CPS: ùëõ=37,822, PES: ùëõ=10,337. Random Digit Dialing (RDD) Internet Survey: CPS: n=4,021, PES: n=2,889.|**Field surveys:** 38 samples of faecal pellets from Costa Rica and Belize, 75 faecal samples in Belize. **Captive behavioral experiments:** 23 call recordings from bats in flight cages. **Acoustic analyses:** 7 free-flying G. soricina.|

| Sampling frame                                        |Records obtained by integrating telephone number lists and address registers, grouping telephone numbers by address, including related and unrelated numbers.|                                             |**Field surveys:** 112 G. soricina bats that were caught. **Captive behavioral experiments:** Captive colony of G. soricina in the UK. **Acoustic analyses:** Acoustic recordings from bats in a flight room.|
| Survey mode(s)                                        |Telephone and online.|Online and telephone.|**Field surveys:** Collection of faecal pellets from natural habitats. **Captive behavioral experiments:** Observational studies and feeding trials. **Acoustic analyses:** Use of acoustic equipment in controlled environments to record echolocation calls.|
| Timeline                                              | September 4th to December 28th, 2018|                                             |**Field surveys:** 7-week period from late May to early July 2009. **Captive behavioral experiments:** 1‚Äì1¬∑5 h on nine consecutive days. **Acoustic analyses:** up to 2¬∑5 h.|
| Response rate                                         |41.9%.|n/a.|**Field surveys:** 66% of the faecal pellets sampled contained insects, 43% of faecal samples (n = 75) collected from G. soricina in Belize contained insect fragments. **Captive behavioral experiments:** n/a. It observed behavior rather than response rate. **Acoustic analyses:** n/a. There are measurements of echolocation calls rather than response rates.|
| Weights                                               |Applied to ensure representativeness. Weighting of persons: 1. Initial weight calculation, 2. Removal of out-of-scope records. 3. Three-stage non-response adjustment. 4. Person weight calculation. 5. Adjustment of person weights for Rejective Sampling. 6. Adjustment of person weights to external totals (6a. Stratum Adjustment, 6b. Income Adjustment, 6c. Province - age - sex adjustment, 6d. Raking ratio adjustments). 7. Final person weight.|Applied to adjust for demographic and voting intention discrepancies.|n/a.|
| Data processing                                       |Automated and manual (standard procedures, validation, consistency checks).|                                             |Acoustic analysis, observation recordings, genetic analysis.|
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |Out-of-scope and nonresponse (were identified and removed). Missing or incorrect information (was corrected deterministically or imputed from other questionnaire information, flow editing was performed using a ‚Äòtop down‚Äô strategy). Imputation Process (supplied valid values for variables with invalid or missing information, preserving the data's structure and ensuring records passed all required edits. Complete non-response: records were dropped and accounted for in weighting. Item non-response: missing answers were coded as ‚Äúnot stated‚Äù or imputed. Partial non-response: records were handled similarly to either complete or multiple item non-response.) Donor imputation was used for some item and partial non-response to fill in missing data.|                                             |**Field data:** Cleaning included identification and categorization of faecal contents, with limitations in species identification due to reference database limitations. **Captive observations:** Data from observations were collected and interpreted with potential learning effects.|
| Sources of error                                      |Sampling error, non-response error, measurement error.|                                             |**Field studies:** limitations in insect species identification due to incomplete reference databases. **Captive behavioral experiments:** variability in feeding and handling times; bias in captivity is possible. **Acoustic analysis:** potential underestimation of call intensity due to constraints.|
| Limitations, known biases                             |Underrepresentation of certain groups.|                                             |**Field studies:** incomplete identification of species; ppotential sampling bias in faecal pellet collection. **Captive behavioral experiments:** limited to observations in captivity; may not fully reflect wild behavior. **Acoustic analysis:** possible underestimation of call intensity; effect of restriction on echolocation.|

# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `3`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to understand how age affects people's music tastes and whether these tastes change over a person's lifetime. If so, how? Especially if it relates to perceptions of popular music.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population: The target population for this survey is people of all ages who have access to music and can provide insights into their music preferences.
Sampling frame: The sampling frame will consist of individuals from different age groups who are available through different platforms (online platforms, community centers, and university contact database).
Sampling units: The sampling units are individual respondents who will complete the survey.
Observational units: The observational units are the specific pieces of information collected from each respondent.
Overall sampling strategy: We'll use a stratified sampling strategy to ensure representation of different age groups. We'll divide the population into age groups (under 18, 18-30, 31-45, 46-60, over 60) and then randomly sample within each group to get a diverse range of responses.
